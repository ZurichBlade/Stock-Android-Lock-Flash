# Stock Android: Lock & Flash

## Description
As a stock Android user, I noticed that my device does not natively support a double tap to lock screen feature. So, I came up with an idea to create a lightweight app that locks my device with a single tap. My main goal was to make it look like a stock app and keep it lightweight.

Additionally, my device has a dedicated Google Assistant button that I don't use. I decided to repurpose it to be useful by remapping it to toggle the device flashlight. Now, it functions as a flashlight toggle.

## Features
- **Soft Lock**: Lock your device with a single tap, mimicking a native feature.
- **Flashlight Toggle**: Repurpose the dedicated Google Assistant button to toggle the device flashlight.

This app aims to enhance the usability of stock Android devices by adding convenient functionalities that improve everyday use.

## Setup FlashLight
To use Google Assisstant button as a Flashlight toggle.
Go to Phone's Settings > System > Gestures > Google Assistant Button > Turn it OFF
